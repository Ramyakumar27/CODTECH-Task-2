## Overview of the project

### Project: Model Evaluation and Comparison

### Objective 
The objective of this project is to Evaluate the performance of AI models (Credict Card Fraud Detection Dataset). The task involves implementing and comparing different AI models using appropriate evaluation metrics
### Key Activities
- **Accuracy** : This metric measures the proportion of correct predictions made by the model. It is often used as a general 
                 measure of performance but can be misleading in certain situations, such as when there is a class imbalance. 
- **Precision** : This metric measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the 
                  model. It can be useful in situations where false positives are particularly costly.

- **Recall** : This metric measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive cases. It is often used 
               in situations where false negatives are particularly costly.

- **F1 score** : This metric is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It takes into account both precision and recall and can 
                 be useful in situations where you want to balance the trade-off between these two metrics.
